# Welcome to KernelCI

The KernelCI project is dedicated to testing the upstream Linux kernel.  Its
mission statement is defined as follows:

> To ensure the quality, stability and long-term maintenance of the Linux
> kernel by maintaining an open ecosystem around test automation practices and
> principles.

KernelCI is a community-driven project, open to anyone who wants to contribute
to the testing of the Linux kernel.  It is not tied to any specific hardware or
lab, and it is not tied to any specific test framework.  The project is
maintained by a group of maintainers who are responsible for the overall
direction of the project, but anyone can contribute to the project by
submitting patches, reporting issues, or participating in the discussions.

Project website: [kernelci.org](https://kernelci.org)
Documentation is available on the [KernelCI docs](https://docs.kernelci.org/).

This repository provides core functions to interact with the KernelCI, such as
KernelCI API, KernelCI pipeline, generating test definitions for LAVA, etc.
