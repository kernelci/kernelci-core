# Welcome to KernelCI

The KernelCI project is dedicated to testing the upstream Linux kernel.  Its
mission statement is defined as follows:

> To ensure the quality, stability and long-term maintenance of the Linux
> kernel by maintaining an open ecosystem around test automation practices and
> principles.

The main instance of KernelCI is available on
[kernelci.org](https://kernelci.org).

There is also a separate instance used for KernelCI development available on
[staging.kernelci.org](https://staging.kernelci.org), see [Development
workflow](doc/staging.md) for all the details about it.

This repository provides core functions to monitor upstream Linux kernel
branches, build many kernel variants, run tests, run bisections and schedule
email reports.

It is also possible to set up an independent instance to build any arbitrary
kernel and run any arbitrary tests.

You can find some more general information about the KernelCI project on the
[wiki](https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-doc/wiki/KernelCI).


## User guide

KernelCI users will typically want to add their kernel branch to be monitored,
connect their lab or send results from their own existing CI system.  The pages
below are a work-in-progress to cover all these topics:

* [Using LAVA with KernelCI](doc/lava.md)


## Command line tools

All the steps of the KernelCI pipeline are implemented with portable command
line tools.  They are used in [Jenkins pipeline
jobs](https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-core/tree/master/jenkins) for
kernelci.org, but can also be run by hand in a shell or integrated with any CI
environment.  The `kernelci/build-base` Docker image comes with all the
dependencies needed.

**The available command line tools are:**

* **[`kci_build`](doc/kci_build.md)** to get the kernel source code, create a
  config file, build kernels and push them to a storage server.

* **[`kci_test`](doc/kci_test.md)** to generate and submit test definitions in
  an automated test lab.

* **[`kci_rootfs`](doc/kci_rootfs.md)** to build a CPU specific rootfs image
  for given OS variant and push them to a storage server.

**Other command line tools are being worked on** to replace the current legacy
implementation which is still tied to Jenkins or hard-coded in shell scripts:

* **`kci_data` (WIP)** to submit KernelCI data to a database and retrieve it.

* **`kci_bisect` (WIP)** to run KernelCI automated bisections.

* **`kci_email` (WIP)** to generate an email report with test results.


## Configuration files

All the builds are configured in
[`build-configs.yaml`](https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-core/blob/master/build-configs.yaml),
with the list of branches to monitor and which kernel variants to build for
each of them.

Then all the tests are configured in
[`test-configs.yaml`](https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-core/blob/master/test-configs.yaml)
with the list of devices, test suites and which tests to run on which devices.

Details for the format of these files can be found on the wiki pages for [build
configurations](https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-doc/wiki/Build-configurations)
and [test
configurations](https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-doc/wiki/Test-configurations).


## Python modules

There are Python modules in the `kernelci` package to parse and use the
configuration data from the YAML files, as well as the
[`kci_build`](https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-core/blob/master/kci_build)
command line tool to access this data directly and implement automated build
jobs.  Each module has some Python docstrings and the command line tool has
detailed help messages for each command it can run.


## Jenkins jobs

All the automated jobs on kernelci.org are run in Jenkins.  Some legacy scripts
are still being used in "freestyle" projects but they are gradually being
replaced with Pipeline jobs.  Each Pipeline job has a `.jpl` file located in
the `jenkins` directory:

* [`jenkins/monitor.jpl`](https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-core/tree/master/jenkins/monitor.jpl) to monitor kernel branches
* [`jenkins/build-trigger.jpl`](https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-core/tree/master/jenkins/build-trigger.jpl) to trigger all the builds for a kernel revision
* [`jenkins/build.jpl`](https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-core/tree/master/jenkins/build.jpl) to build each individual kernel
* [`jenkins/bisect.jpl`](https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-core/tree/master/jenkins/bisect.jpl) to run boot bisections
* [`jenkins/buster.jpl`](https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-core/tree/master/jenkins/buster.jpl) to build a Debian Buster file system

There are other variants based on `stretch.jpl` to build other file systems
with extra tools needed to run specific test suites.

In addition to the job files, there are also some common library files located
in the
[`src/org/kernelci`](https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-core/tree/master/src/org/kernelci)
directory.


## Dockerfiles

Each Jenkins Pipeline job runs in a Docker container.  The Docker images used
by these containers are built from `jenkins/dockerfiles` and pushed to the
[`kernelci Docker repositories`](https://cloud.docker.com/u/kernelci/repository/list).


## Test templates

The kernelci.org tests typically run in [LAVA](https://lavasoftware.org/).
Each LAVA test is generated using template files which can be found in the
[`templates`](https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-core/tree/master/templates)
directory.
