## `kci_test`

The output of [`kci_build`](kci_build.md) can be used with the
[`kci_test`](https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-core/blob/master/kci_test)
tool to generate and submit test definitions.  It will be using the meta-data
JSON files produced by `kci_build` and will also need to communicate with the
test labs where to run the tests.  Currently, only
[LAVA](https://www.lavasoftware.org/) is fully supported but other types of lab
can be added.  Test configurations can be found in
[`test-configs.yaml`](https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-core/blob/master/test-configs.yaml)
with the list of test plans and which devices should run them.  Likewise, the
lab configurations can be found in
[`lab-configs.yaml`](https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-core/blob/master/lab-configs.yaml).

Each lab is expected to have a remote API available with a URL and a user
authentication token.

Running `kci_build` does not strictly require anything else than the kernel
binaries with metadata and a lab to run tests, typically LAVA.  If a
`kernelci-backend` instance is available, it can be used to store test results.

The example below uses the build output from the commands shown in the
[`kci_build`](kci_build.md) section to generate and submit tests in a lab:

### 1. Optional: save a local copy of any lab-specific data

Generating a test definition relies on some information that may only be
provided by the particular lab where the test needs to be submitted.  For
example, some labs have soecial names for their device types.  Retrieving this
information every time a job definition is generated can result in a
significant overhead while in practice this information doesn't change very
often.

To avoid repeating the same queries with the labs, the `kci_test get_lab_info`
command can be used to store it locally in a JSON file and then reuse it with
subsequent commands.  This is mostly useful when running automated jobs that
will determine when to get the information again (say, once for each kernel
revision being built, or once every hour...).  When submitting only a few jobs
manually, the overhead may not be so much of a problem.

Here's a sample command to get the data from a lab and store it in a JSON file:

```
./kci_test get_lab_info \
  --user=kernelci-user-name \
  --lab-config=lab-name \
  --lab-token=abcd-7890 \
  --lab-json=lab-name.json
```

### 2. Generate test definitions

The `kci_test generate` command will generate test definitions for a given set
of build meta-data and a given lab.  It can either generate all the compatible
test definitions based on the `test_config` entries in `test-configs.yaml`, or
a subset of it, or a single arbitrary one specified entirely on the command
line.

The `--callback-id` and `--callback-url` options are only used to get a
callback from the test lab to a service who can receive it.  It is not required
to generate and run a job, if the results can be shared by other means or
manually retrieved.

To generate the definitions of all the jobs that can be run in a lab:

```
./kci_test generate \
  --bmeta-json=linux/_install_/bmeta.json \
  --dtbs-json=linux/_install_/dtbs.json \
  --lab-json=lab-name.json \
  --storage=https://some-storage-place.com/ \
  --user=kernelci-user-name \
  --lab-config=lab-name \
  --lab-token=abcd-7890 \
  --output=jobs \
  --callback-id=kernelci-callback \
  --callback-url=https://callback-recipient.com/handler/
```

Extra options can be added to only generate a subset of those jobs, filtering
by test plan, target or machine type respectively:

```
--plan=baseline
```

```
--target=odroid-xu3
```

```
--mach=qemu
```

To generate only one job definition with an arbitrary combination of test plan
and target, even if it is not listed in any `test_config` entry:

```
./kci_test generate
  --bmeta-json=linux/_install_/bmeta.json \
  --dtbs-json=linux/_install_/dtbs.json \
  --plan=baseline_qemu \
  --target=qemu_arm64-virt-gicv3 \
  --user=kernelci-user-name \
  --lab-config=lab-name \
  --lab-token=abcd-7890 \
  --lab-json=lab-name.json \
  --storage=https://some-storage-place.com/ \
  --callback-id=kernelci-callback-local \
  --callback-url=https://callback-recipient.com/handler/ \
  > job.yaml
```

### 3. Submit tests

Once the test job definitions have been generated and stored in some files,
they can be submitted to the test lab with the `kci_test submit` command:

```
./kci_test submit \
  --user=kernelci-user-name \
  --lab-config=lab-name \
  --lab-token=abcd-7890 \
  --jobs=jobs/*
```

What happens next depends on where the test was scheduled and whether there is
a service such as `kernelci-backend` to receive LAVA callback data.
